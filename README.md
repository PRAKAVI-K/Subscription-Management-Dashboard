# React Subscription Management UI

This is a standalone React application that allows users to **subscribe to a plan, view their active plan, and manage their profile — with a clean and responsive UI**.

The interface is built using **glassmorphism effects** combined with **Royal UI styling**, giving the design a modern, smooth, and visually rich experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes performance.

### `npm run eject`

⚠ **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot go back.

This copies all configuration files and build dependencies into your project so you have full control over them.

You never need to use `eject` unless you want full customization.
